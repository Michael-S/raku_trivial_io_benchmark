GitHub offers many features and has become the default place people
share and search for source code. But centralizing everything in
one location is risky.

I am making a practice of dual-hosting my projects.
For this project:
https://github.com/Michael-S/raku_trivial_io_benchmark
and
https://git.sr.ht/~mikeswierczek/raku_trivial_io_benchmark
